Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

Files for the project of Coursera course on Getting and Cleaning data

Assumptions: mean features and standerd deviation features are the features that contain "mean()" and "std()" expressions in them.

Note: My script creates two Tidy datasets as asked in the course instructions. 1st one is the labelled dataset which contains merged data.frames for Test and Train. 2nd one contains further processed 1st data.frame to give average values of the Activities for each Subject.

Please see the CodeBook.md for more information about the processings that have been done on the dataset.
